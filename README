war3observer
-----------------

war3observer is a tool that keeps a local webpage updated with data
from the Warcraft III observer API. This can be used for streaming
tools such as OBS to render the data on stream.

It runs a local websocket server which sends a message with the entire
game's state (if you are in a game) periodically. It uses war3structs
to parse the state from the memory mapped file.

Status
-----------------

Currently, the "client" is just an html file that renders the json from
the websocket server in a <pre> tag. The intention is to add a nice
mithril.js interface (lightweight javascript ui framework) to render
the state in a nicer way while also being customizable with component
inheritance and CSS overrides.

A tool will also exist in this repository to extract all icons from an
installation's CASC data and put them into a directory named by their
in-game id.

I have not yet figured out the API for POV (non-observer) games which,
judging from what I've seen from certain other streams, still gives you
information on your own heroes and the opponent's name. I think it may
be in a different file under a different tag name.
